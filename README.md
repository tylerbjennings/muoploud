Cycling has become increasingly popular in Europe in recent years. 
It is noticed that nowadays bikes are sold better than cars. As a result, there are more and more cyclists on the roads. You can see them everywhere; that is why cities have to adapt to the new demands of their citizens. New bicycle paths and spaces are made for this aim. If Dutch cities are leading in that, the UK also tries to catch up. The UK has been able to adapt and make new projects for pedestrians and cyclists by proposing alternatives to the car.
In some European countries, there is a self-service bike rental system.
This was done in order to encourage people to leave their cars in the garage and to go by bicycle more often. 
You can use a service occasionally (just for a day or a week) or opt for a subscription to the year. The service 
is available seven days a week, twenty-four hours around the clock. The first half of an hour is free.
To rent a bike, you have to identify yourself on a terminal and choose one of the proposals
